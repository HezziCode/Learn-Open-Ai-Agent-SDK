# 🤖 AI Agent Handoffs - Like Having Super Smart Friends!

### 🧮 Math Agent (The Math Teacher)

- **What they're good at**: Solving math problems like 2+2, 5+3, etc.
- **Personality**: A helpful math teacher who loves numbers
- **Special tool**: Can add numbers together using a special calculator

### 🌤️ Assistant Agent (The Team Leader)

- **What they're good at**: Deciding which friend should help with what task
- **Personality**: A helpful assistant who knows everyone's strengths
- **Special tools**:
  - Can check the weather in any city
  - Can ask the Math Agent for help with math problems

## 🤝 How Do Handoffs Work?

Think of handoffs like this:

1. **You ask a question**: "What's the weather in Karachi and what's 2+2?"

2. **Assistant Agent thinks**: "Hmm, this person wants two things:

   - Weather info (I can do this!)
   - Math problem (My math friend is better at this!)"

3. **Assistant Agent does the weather part**: Checks Karachi weather

4. **Assistant Agent hands off the math**: "Hey Math Agent, can you solve 2+2?"

5. **Math Agent solves it**: "Sure! 2+2 = 4"

6. **Assistant Agent gives you both answers**: Weather info + math answer

## 🎯 Why is this Cool?

### 🔄 Teamwork

Instead of one robot trying to do everything (and maybe not being great at some things), we have specialists who are really good at their specific jobs!

### 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Input Filters**: Like having a security guard who makes sure only safe information gets passed between friends
- **Custom Controls**: We can turn handoffs on/off (like if someone hasn't paid for premium features)
- **Data Validation**: Making sure the information being passed is in the right format

### 🎨 Customization

- We can give our AI friends custom names and descriptions
- We can control exactly what information gets shared
- We can add special functions that run when handoffs happen

## 🏃‍♂️ What Happens When You Run This?

When you run the code, here's the magic:

1. **Setup**: Creates our two AI friends (Assistant and Math Agent)
2. **Question**: Asks both about weather and math
3. **Teamwork**: Assistant handles weather, hands off math to Math Agent
4. **Results**: You get answers to both questions!
5. **Info**: Shows you which agent gave the final answer

## 🧩 The Special Parts

### 🔧 Custom Handoff Features

- **Tool Name Override**: We can call our Math Agent "math_teacher" instead of its real name
- **Description Override**: We can change how the agent describes itself
- **On Handoff Function**: Special code that runs when the handoff happens
- **Input Type**: Makes sure only the right kind of information gets passed
- **Enable/Disable**: Can turn the handoff on or off based on rules

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Remove All Tools**: When handing off, we remove sensitive tool information for safety
- **Context Sharing**: We can share user information (like name, age, role) safely

## 🎈 Fun Analogy

Think of this like a restaurant:

- **You** are the customer with an order
- **Assistant Agent** is the waiter who takes your order
- **Math Agent** is the chef who specializes in "math dishes"
- **Handoff** is when the waiter gives your math order to the chef
- **Result** is when you get your complete meal (weather + math answer)

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This shows how AI can work together as a team, just like humans do! Instead of having one super-complicated AI that tries to do everything, we can have simple, specialized AIs that are really good at their specific jobs and know when to ask for help.

It's like having the best team ever - everyone knows their role and works together perfectly! 🌟
