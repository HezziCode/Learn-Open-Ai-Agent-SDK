# Context is an overloaded term Context refers to the data that the LLM does not have by default,
# and we can provide this data through various methods, such as system messages, user prompts,
# or tool schemas.



# Note about Generics:
# Generics allow us to define an Agent with a specific type of context. 
# This ensures type-safety and helps the IDE give better suggestions.



# local context represent RunContextWrapper or it can hold any normal Python object including ones 
# made with dataclasses or Pydantic.

# This part of code is called generics
