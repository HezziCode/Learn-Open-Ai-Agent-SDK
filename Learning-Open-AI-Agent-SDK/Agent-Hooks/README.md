## What are Agent Hooks? 🎣

Agent Hooks are like special connection points that let us control how our agent behaves. Imagine them as "pause points" where we can add special instructions or checks before the agent does something.

## Why Do We Need Hooks? 🎯

Here's a simple example:

- Maybe you want your agent to always say "please" and "thank you"
- Or you want to make sure it never shares private information
- Or you want to log everything it does

Hooks let us add these kinds of rules easily!

## Types of Hooks We Can Use 📝

1. **Before Messages Hook**

   - This runs before the agent sends any message
   - Like checking what you're about to say before saying it

2. **After Messages Hook**

   - This runs after the agent sends a message
   - Like keeping a record of what was said

3. **Tool Hooks**
   - These run before and after using any tool
   - Like double-checking if it's okay to use a certain tool

## How It Makes Things Better 🌟

- Makes agents more reliable
- Adds safety checks
- Helps keep track of what the agent does
- Makes it easier to fix problems

## Simple Example 📚

Imagine you have a smart coffee machine (that's your agent). You can add hooks to:

1. Check if there's enough water before making coffee (before hook)
2. Record how many cups were made (after hook)
3. Make sure it's not making coffee at midnight (safety check)
